libQGLViewer is an open source C++ library based on Qt that enables the quick creation 
of OpenGL 3D viewers.  It features a powerful camera trackball and simple applications 
simply  require an implementation of the  draw() function.  It is a tool of choice for
OpenGL beginners and  assignements.  It provides screenshot saving,  mouse manipulated
frames, stereo display, interpolated keyFrames, object selection, and much more. It is
fully customizable and easy to extend to create complex applications, with an optional
Qt GUI.

libQGLViewer is not a 3D viewer that can be used directly to view 3D scenes in various
formats.  It is more likely to be the starting  point for the coding of such a viewer.
Since it is based on the Qt toolkit, it compiles on any architecture (Unix-Linux, Mac,
Windows, ...). Full reference documentation and many examples are provided. 

The viewer's main functionalities are : 

     - A camera trackball to easily move the camera in the scene (explorer
       or fly mode).
     - Screenshot saving in different file formats (JPG, PNG, EPS...). 
     - Handling  of local (possibly hierarchical) coordinate systems, that
       can be moved with the mouse. 
     - Extendable  displacement  constraints  that  can  be applied on the
       displacement of those frames. 
     - FPS and axis display, fast drawing of the scene and many convenient
       functions.
     - Definition and replay of KeyFrame paths.
     - Stereo display (if your machine supports it). 
     - Many simple examples illustrating the different functionalities and
       a complete reference documentation.
